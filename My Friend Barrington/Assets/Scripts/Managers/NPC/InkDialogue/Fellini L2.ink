=== greeting === 
Oh! Barrington, it's good to see you...

I don't know where everyone else went... And then those awful noises started... I don't know what to do...

I'm... I'm really scared...

But... now that you're here, maybe we can do something?

Could you collect four piles of pillows for me? If you do, I'll let you stay in here with me!
