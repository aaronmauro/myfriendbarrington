Access GitHub: 

School Computer using GitHub:  

Find GitHub Desktop on desktop https://github.com/aaronmauro/myfriendbarrington   

Login to your GitHub Account  

Select "myfriendbarrington" and select "Clone myfriendbarrington"  

Optional but suggested (remember/change the Local path to a place you will remember)  

Click "Clone" 

Click on "Current branch" on top left, click on branches corresponding to your role. 

Click on "Show in Explorer"  

Click on "My Friend Barrington"  

Click on "Assets"  

Click on "Scenes"  

Select any Unity scene file ending with ".unity" (ex. Lvl1.unity, test.unity)

Wait and Have Fun Good Luck  


Personal Computer using GitHub:  

Follow the first 5 steps ONCE (don't repeat this step each time, unless something happened)

Remember your file location is very important on personal computer  

On top of the GitHub Desktop find "Fetch origin" and click on it every time you wanted to access to the file (updating the file each time you use)  

Follow step 6-11 if you wanted to access to the game  

if anything happen ping any programmer  

For Commit and Pushing to GitHub:  

Before pushing to GitHub server, remember to check and save in Unity  

Open GitHub Desktop that is already on your screen  

On the bottom left find text box "Summary (required)" Write something (ex. Updated on Frog Enemies, Just anything for other people to see, keep it simple)  

For the text box below, "Description", this is optional for people want to write more detail  

Click on the blue button "Commit to main"  

Find "Push origin" button and click SUPER IMPORTANT  

You are free to close the GitHub Desktop and Unity  

Additionally:  
If you want to find the cloned file, Open GitHub Desktop, Find and click on "Show in Explorer" / click on "Repository" and click on "Show in Explorer" / Ctrl + Shift + F 

https://github.com/aaronmauro/myfriendbarrington/branches/all

There will be 3 branches use correct department branch, if pushing to main let Programmer team know 

When merging or updating branch make sure each branch has been pushed before merging to main
